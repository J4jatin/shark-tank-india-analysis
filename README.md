# shark-tank-india-analysis
In this notebook, we will be exploring the data from the show to answer some interesting questions about the sharks, the deals, and the companies.

We will start by looking at the probability of a deal being made. We will then see which shark is the most likely to invest in a deal, and which industry is the most popular for the sharks to invest in.

The following insights about Shark Tank were generated in this project:
*Percentage of comapnies got investment or not?
*All 5 shark deals
*Highest pitch ask amount
*Asked equity vs deal equity
*Least amount pitch
*No. of brands the sharks have invested
*Above 50% Equity taken by the shark in which brand
*Equity Offered by entrepreneurs to the investors in deals
*Average amount invested in the deals made
*Correlation between the pitchers asking valuation and the actual deal valuation
*Success Rate of Deals Made by Shark
*Relationship between the amount of investment and the equity offered by entrepreneurs
*Realtionship between Ask Valuation and Ask Equity made by entreprenuer
*Relationship between Pitch Valuation, Equity Offered, and Deal Amount
